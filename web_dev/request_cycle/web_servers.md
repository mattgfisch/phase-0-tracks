1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

The Linux philosophy is centered on the idea that the user knows what they are doing. It isn't designed to stop users from doing harmful things because it would also prevent them from doing useful and clever things. All users have the same amount of absolute power, which can be viewed as an egalitarian approach.

2. In your own words, what is a VPS? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS (Virtual Private Server) is a virtual machine created by software that emulates the behavior and functionality of a physical server. It must exist on some physical server (host platform) and that server creates the VPS by allocating some amount of space for it.

The advantages of using a VPS are that they are cheap (accessible to startups), work well for entry and medium level web hosting, and can be used to test an application on different operating systems (Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, etc.).  

3. Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

You have access to all the files in the system, including the system files that keep the system running. A mistake by the user could result in the entire system crashing. Additionally, a buggy or malicious program could do the work for you. It's best to log in as your own user account.
