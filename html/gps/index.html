- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
    - HTML5 semantic tags add specific meaning to your content, without changing how it appears. They are used to define what a section of your web page is, rather than how it is supposed to look. Section, main, nav, footer, and header are the tags I see to be the most useful. By just using those tags, you would be able to improve accessibility to most websites.

- What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
    - The browser reads the HTML from top to bottom and displays the content in that order.

- What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
    - I originally thought that the only shortcuts you could use in Sublime were pre-packaged, but I learned during this module that Sublime allows for a great degree of customization. I'll definitely create more snippets for bits of code that are fairly standard, but I'll try not to rely on them too much because the content of a page is rarely so formulaic.

- What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
    - I had trouble understanding the use and purpose of some of the semantic elements. Working through the list with my guide and pair helped considerably, but I think to gain a deeper understanding of how to use them I'll have to look at the HTML Documentation.
