# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  Version control is a way to manage non-linear changes to code from multiple sources. It allows for you to split up projects into parts that can be worked on separately and won't interfere with each other as changes are being made. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  A branch is essentially a copy of the base code that can be worked on separately from the base. It's another version. You would use one if you wanted to test and make changes to a project without altering the current working copy. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  A commit way to finalize the version of the branch you are currently working on. It is the final step before pushing the commit to the master branch. A good commit message accurately describes what changes were made and how they will affect the project. 
* What is a merge conflict?
  A merge conflict is when two separate changes have been made to the same file, usually even the same lines, and Git cannot decide which change to use. Git then marks that file as conflict and the user will have to solve the conflict on their own.
